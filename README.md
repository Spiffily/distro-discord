# Distro discord

A little app thing that shows your distro as your Discord rich presence.

## Installation
Installation is very simple.

1. run `cd ~/.local/share && git clone https://github.com/Spiffily/distro-discord.git && cd distro-discord && ./distro-discord install`
2. Add the `distro-discord`command to your DE startup apps.
3. Log out and log in or run `distro-discord`.

On macOS, just run `cd ~/.local/share && git clone https://github.com/Spiffily/distro-discord.git && cd distro-discord`. For now you'll have to run it manually any time you want to use it. We're working on a solution.

Windows is not currently supported.
